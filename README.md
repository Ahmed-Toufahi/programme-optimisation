This is a python program leveraging the power of optimization to solve business problems.
The program takes business information (such as availabe work hours, price of products, constraints of cost etc...) to compute the optimal choice that allow the maximization of goal (such as minimizing cost or increasing profit)
I used Gurobi, the powerful proprietary optimizer, to do the heavy lifting of the mathematical optimization.
